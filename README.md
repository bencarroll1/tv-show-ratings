# TV Show Ratings

## Overview
Using R, I carried out an analysis of the IMDb and The Movie Database television show datasets to find correlations between TV show ratings between the databases. I used a couple of R libraries for this project including: "dplyr", "httr", "jsonlite", "rlist", "data.table", "rtidy", "ggthemes", "ggplot2", "reshape", "tm", and "wordcloud". 

I followed the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) methodology for this project.

## Aims
To carry out an analysis of IMDb and The Movie Database television show datasets to find any correlation between each datasets ratings of television shows, the correlation between a high level of popularity in television shows and ratings, and if certain genres, on average, get higher ratings than others.

## KDD Methodology
I carried out this project usign the KDD methodology which included the selection, pre-processing, transformation, and interpretation/evaluation of the data.

I wrote about following this methodology in detail and an IEEE formatted report can be found in this repository.

The findings of the project can also be found in the above report.
